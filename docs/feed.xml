&lt;p&gt;At the start of my 4th Year at INSA Rennes, our teacher needed someone to take care of the conferences with professionals. 
He is always looking look for contacts who are willing to give a conference for the students but he can’t always be there to welcome them when they come. 
So, with two other students, we took upon us the task of welcoming the conference speakers get them what they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be it when we were exchanging mails to prepare the things they might need or when we accompanied them to the conference room, 
we had a little time to chat about their conference’s subject and they would occasionally ask about us students and our familiarity with the subjects. 
And I often realised that most people in the industry don’t really know what we do here.. 
I can’t blame them, they only know us through internships or these kind of conferences, 
they might know that one alumni who worked in their company on that project, but that will tell nothing about the formation itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I figured I would try to summarize what students in Computer Science at INSA Rennes learn during their studies, as that could help recruiters know what they can expect.
But the writing of this article took an particular turn, and for a simple reason : It is almost impossible to make generalizations about CS engineering students !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teachers were not exaggerating when they said that no two INSA Engineers are alike, at least that’s true for the CS department
I mean almost half of what we do is choice-based : group projects, options, specializations, etc..
Of course we do have a common set of courses that every CS student attends, and I will try to summarize in a dedicated section, 
but for the rest, the best I can do is provide you with questions you can ask a student to get to know what they are like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-common-cursus&quot;&gt;The common cursus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;specializations&quot;&gt;Specializations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;group-projects&quot;&gt;Group projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;internship&quot;&gt;Internship&lt;/h2&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
