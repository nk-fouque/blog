# Welcome

This project has been originally developed as a mean to :
- Learn to use github-pages
- Learn to develop websites using bootstrap and HTML
- Serve as my CV and showcase my projects

## Development

I'm open to any type of suggestions !

### Current focus

- Finish migrating my old site's content to data files (So that if someone wants to use it as a template they don't have to look into the layouts)
- Improve the blog's aesthetics
- Find interesting features for the blog

### Future objectives

- Find something to talk about in the blog

# Credits

## Resume
Started as a template [Resume](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume) from Start Bootstrap and added more and more of personal content

## Jekyll
Migrated to Jekyll in April 2020 to add blog functionalities
Blog Jekyll theme made by myself by salvaging code pieces from 
- [Blog Post](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-blog-post) Template from StartBootstrap
- [Blog Home Page](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-blog-home) Template from StartBootstrap
- [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll/) theme from bootstrapstarter.com

# Commits

Inspired by Angular's contributing guidelines this is meant as git hygiene rules for myself, as I'm not expecting anyone to contribute to this   
The title of a commit follows this pattern : \<type>(\<scope>): \<subject>

## Type
- content: Changes / additions to the mardown/yml files that only impact the site's content
- docs: Documentation only changes
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- refactor: Modification of the code without adding features nor bugs (rename, white-space, ...)
- style: CSS or layout modifications or debug
- serve: Built the site using serve command, this type of commit doesn't need a subject, normally this should only make modifications in ```/docs``` 

## Scope
- General
- Blog
- Jekyll
